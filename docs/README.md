# Cloaked
A Chrome Extension for hiding Destiny 2 Spoilers. 

This extension attempts to hide all Destiny related spoilers by blurring out elements containing any related content. It works best on static pages like wikipedia or IGN, but can also handle dynamic pages from Facebook and user Twitter feeds. Cloaked does not currently support the active filtering of any other sites with dynamic news feeds, but may eventually be expanded to include additional sites based on requests.
